A joke program for Bliss Browser to test browser functionality (toolbars)
Slogan: "Toolbars all the way down to your ankles"
When activated: Toolbars will begin to spawn down the screen at a user defined speed, until they reach Y=0
Customizations: adjust what fake/real toolbars show up, control the speed of their spawning
Quit: A large, red, horizontal, rectangular close button will appear at the top of the screen in the middle. This reverts the toolbars back to how they were before running the program. Ths size of this button can be customized, or the button can be removed, where it will be replaced with a user-defined keyboard shortcut
